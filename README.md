# Python image classification using MobileNetV2
The idea is to use pretrained deep learning algorithms such as mobilenet to predict objects in a image. 

## Prerequisites

``` pip install tensorflow ```

``` pip install numpy ```

``` pip install pillow ```

``` python main.py ```

or just run

``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt 
python main.py 
```

You can use Jupyter notebook to run the code. In that case, download anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual and install the above libraries and launch Jupyter notebook.
