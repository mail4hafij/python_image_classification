# Python image classification using MobileNetV2
Comming soon!!! There are four ideas 

1. The first idea is to build a simple neural network to recognize floating numbers less than .5 and label them as 0, and 1 otherwise.
2. The second idea is to use pretrained deep learning algorithms such as mobilenetV2 and modify the neural network to train more data. 
3. The third idea is to demonstrate object classifcation on a image.
4. The third idea is to demonstrate object classification on a live video feed.

## Prerequisites

``` pip install tensorflow ```

``` pip install numpy ```

``` pip install pillow ```

``` python main.py ```

or just run

``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt 
python round_operation_neural_network.py 
```

You can use Jupyter notebook to run the code. In that case, download anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual and install the above libraries and launch Jupyter notebook.
